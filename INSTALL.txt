1) Extract the archive

2) Install 
This package uses distutils to install.
After you extracted the archive and moved to the extracted directory:

$ python setup.py install --user # to install in $HOME/.local
$ python setup.py install --prefix=<path> # to install in a custom directory
$ python setup.py install # for system wide installation

3) Configure API keys
You need to set the API keys provided by flickr.
For this set the value in $INSTALL_DIR/flickr_api/flickr_keys.py.
It should look like :

API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
API_SECRET = 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'

where x's and y's are replaced by the values provided by flickr.
