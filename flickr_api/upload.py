        calls, see the authentication api spec. Note that the 'photo' parameter 
        should not be included in the signature. All other POST parameters

        photo_file
            The file to upload.
        photo_id
            The ID of the photo to replace.
        async (optional)

            a socket connection open the whole time. Processing photos 
            asynchronously is recommended. Please consult the documentation
